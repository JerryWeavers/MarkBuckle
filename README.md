# Mark Buckle 

I'm Mark from Newfoundland. I do content design and development.

Outside of the student life I am working on a Web App passion project; building a personalized health dashboard. This is a big endeavour for me but it's where my inspiration to learn coding comes from. I would love collaborate with other individuals who are also passionate about Healthcare innovation to help build this platform. Feel free to reach out if you're interested.
