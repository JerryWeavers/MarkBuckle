### Good day,

**markbuckle/markbuckle** is a special repository because its 'README.md' (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Mark from Newfoundland, and I do content design and development. I'm relatively new to the coding scene. So far I have experience in the basics (HTML, CSS & Javascript) and I am  enrolled in the Code To Career/BrainStation Software Engineer bootcamp (12 weeks) beginning June 4th, 2024 to learn other languages and both back and front end development. I also have some new experience with WebApp development via Webflow. I took a course through the GetCoding group (highly recommend) and I've been sharpening my skills with Webflow ever since.

Outside of the student life I am working on a little (yet big in terms of coding requirements) passion project; building a personalized health dashboard. This is a big endeavour for me but it's where my inspiration to learn coding comes from. I would love collaborate with other individuals who are also passionate about Healthcare innovation to help build this platform. Feel free to reach out if you're interested.
